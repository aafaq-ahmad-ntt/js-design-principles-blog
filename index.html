    <h1>JavaScript Design Principles: Best Practices for Writing Clean, Maintainable Code</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is one of the most versatile and powerful programming languages in the world today. However, writing
        clean, maintainable code requires following certain design principles. Let’s dive into some key principles every
        JavaScript developer should follow.</p>
    <h2>1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h2>
    <p>Every module or function should have one, and only one, reason to change. This principle promotes separation of
        concerns, making code easier to understand and modify.</p>
    <h2>2. DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)</h2>
    <p>Avoid duplicating code by abstracting repeated logic into functions or modules. This makes your codebase more
        concise and easier to maintain.</p>
    <h2>3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)</h2>
    <p>Write simple, straightforward code. Avoid complex solutions when a simpler approach would suffice. Readability
        and simplicity should be prioritized over clever tricks.</p>
    <h2>4. YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)</h2>
    <p>Don’t add functionality until it’s necessary. Premature optimization or feature-building can lead to bloated
        codebases.</p>
    <h2>5. Composition Over Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Favor composition over inheritance for code reuse. Instead of building complex hierarchies, build smaller,
        reusable modules and compose them together.</p>
    <h2>6. Immutability</h2>
    <p>Avoid mutating data directly. Instead, return new copies of data structures with changes applied. This approach
        reduces bugs and makes debugging easier.</p>
    <h2>7. SOLID Principles</h2>
    <p>SOLID is a set of five design principles aimed at making software more understandable, flexible, and
        maintainable:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Single Responsibility Principle</li>
        <li>Open/Closed Principle</li>
        <li>Liskov Substitution Principle</li>
        <li>Interface Segregation Principle</li>
        <li>Dependency Inversion Principle</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Following these JavaScript design principles will help you write cleaner, maintainable, and scalable code.
        Remember, the goal is to make your code understandable not just to the machine but also to fellow developers.
